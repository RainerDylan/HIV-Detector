# Global HIV Risk Classification

This project analyzes "Global HIV Risks" by classifying countries into "High Risk" or "Low Risk" categories using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Centroid-Based Classification. The dataset includes various numerical features such as prevalence, ART Coverage, Healthcare Expenditure, HIV Incidence Rate, and Physicians.

# Features:
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier
  - Euclidean Distance
  - Cosine Similarity
  - Mahalanobis Distance
Centroid-Based Classifier
  - Euclidean Distance
  - Cosine Similarity
  - Mahalanobis Distance
Cross-Validation (5-fold)
  - Accuracy & Precision Metrics
Predictions for 47 Test Countries
